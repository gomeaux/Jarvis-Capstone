# Jarvis-Capstone

This is Jarvis, a chess engine written in C++ and my Spring 2025 capstone project. It is named after the AI in the Iron Man movies. 

Though I want to keep improving Jarvis in the future, I also want to preserve what I consider the first "complete" version to look back on. Because of that, this repository will not be updated.

Should anyone actually want to try out Jarvis, it was programmed using Visual Studio 2022. Use MSVC to compile, and use a chess GUI like En Croissant or Cute Chess (my choice) to run. There are bugs and limitations that I am well aware of, such as Jarvis not taking time constraints into consideration and move evaluation being strange for lack of a better term.
